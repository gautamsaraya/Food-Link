i am building a new project named food-link which is a food waste reduction app. in this their are two types of users: the restaurants and the charity orgs. they'll be asked about thir type during the sign-up/sign-in. also during the authenctication, i'll take their current location as well by using the google api (the required one). now, during the breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner hours, if the any restaurant is having extra food, they'll put the details of it on the website. now for the charity orgs at the same time, these details will be visible. also they'll be shown the restaurants which are within the 15km radius only. now the charity org will put up a request to the restaurant by pressing a button (visible) and if the restaurant accepts the request, both the charity org and the restaurant will be lead up to a chatting interface where they can discuss the furthur details about pickup, food and other things which we don't care about but will be stored within our database (just like a normal chat app). 
i want to build this using MERN stack and tailwind css. i've done the basic set-up for the same. now guide me the pathway/steps to build this app.
